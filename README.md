- **Environment variables** - Switch between dev/prod/test environments
- **File uploads** - Support for multipart/form-data
- **Syntax highlighting** - Beautiful HTTP syntax coloring
- **Version control friendly** - Plain text files work with Git
- **Fast and lightweight** - No heavy GUI, just your editor
